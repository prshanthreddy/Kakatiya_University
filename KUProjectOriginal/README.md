# WEBSITE FOR SUBMISSION OF PH.D. THESIS BY SCHOLARS OF KAKATIYA UNIVERSITY
## About The Project
Managing and coordinating thesis processes could be a tedious task. Scholars, supervisors, panels and administration must be coordinated properly for document and requirement submissions, defense scheduling up to different related activities concerning the needs like paying the fee at the university office, collecting the receipt that must be submitted to the university authorities along with all the other documents like memos, admission orders, etc. Even after submission, applications have to be verified by several departments in the university. Physically applications are transported from one department to another. This is a draggy process of verification, there is a most probable chance of applications getting lost, damaged, etc. This leads to the resubmission of documents and thesis which is again a complicated process. Our project provides an effective method for scholars to utilize the online facilities.

The growing significance of websites for various organizations is well known. The university authorities had the feeling of maintaining a comprehensive website for the submission and evaluation of the Ph.D. thesis. This project is based on the development of a fully functional website to facilitate the submission and verification of applications, submitted by scholars in online mode.
